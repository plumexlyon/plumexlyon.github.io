Christopher Madec, en thèse sous la direction de Sylvain Joubaud et J. John
Soundar Jérôme, soutiendra sa thèse le 8 juillet 2021.
Sa thèse s'intitule « Remontée de bulle(s) au sein d'une suspension dans une cellule de
Hele-Shaw ».

Le projet PlumeX a permis l'acquisition du matériel nécessaire à la fabrication des échantillons,
ainsi qu'à l'acquisition des données.

**Résumé en anglais**

Multiphase flow involving gas, liquid, and solid particles plays a vital role
in catalytic fluidized beds, subsea gas release, and even in avalanches and
volcanic eruptions. Bubble rise and interactions is a fundamental ingredient
for many such industrial processes and geophysical phenomena. Here, the
canonical problem of the rising motion of a single bubble and bubble-bubble
interactions is investigated in a Hele-Shaw cell containing a granular
suspension through simple experiments and theoretical models.

In a Newtonian liquid, it is shown that the rise velocity :math:`v_b` of a single
bubble of diameter :math:`d_b` evolving between two plates separated by a thickness
:math:`h` increases with :math:`d_b` up to a maximum value for :math:`d_b \gg h`, when the
Reynolds number :math:`Re = v_bd_b/\nu_f(h/d_b)^2` is very small.
In the case of a neutrally-buoyant non-Brownian suspension, bubble speed is
demonstrated to be faster in suspensions than in particle-less liquids of the
same effective viscosity. By carefully measuring this bubble speed increase at
various particle volume fraction and via velocity field imaging, this new
bubble dynamics is linked to a reduction in the bulk dissipation rate. A good
match between our experimental data and computations based on Suspension
Balance Model illustrates that the underlying mechanism for this
dissipation-rate deficit is related to a non-uniform particle distribution in
the direction perpendicular to the channel walls due to shear-induced particle
migration.

The second part of this thesis deals with the dynamics of bubble-bubble
interactions and bubble chains rising in a Newtonian liquid.
When several bubbles interact with each other, they first show a steady
approach, they accelerate and undergo sharp shape changes until they come into
contact. By considering the neighboring bubble's influence on the pressure
field and the reduction in the dissipation, it is possible to qualitatively
describe the bubble merging process. After merging, the bubble chain remains
intact and their dynamics, when compared to the single bubble rise, is slower.
In addition, spatial reorganizations within the same train of bubbles are
observed.

These results provide a promising avenue for studying bubble-bubble merging and
bubble(s)-particle interaction in the context of complex multiphase flow.
